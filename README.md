# WS2812B_STM32_Libmaple
WS2812B (Neopixel) library for Arduino STM32 (Libmaple core)

Written by Roger Clark www.rogerclark.net, from first principals

This library uses SPI DMA to control a strip of WS2812B (NeoPixel) LEDS

It should be generally compatible with the Adafruit NeoPixel library, 

For additional technical details see: <https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/WS2812B_STM32_Libmaple/blob/master/README.md>

Updated with modificatons by Aram Prez to support SPI2.
